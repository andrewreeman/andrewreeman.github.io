<h1>Spectral Suite version 2.1.4 released</h1>
<p>Version 2.1.4 of the <a href="/spectralsuite">Spectral Suite</a> has now been released.</p>
<p>This adds a new fft type which can be selected in the settings. This was an attempt at creating a <a href="https://sethares.engr.wisc.edu/vocoders/phasevocoder.html">'Phase Vocoder'</a> style fft which should in theory yield more accurate frequency estimates. However, I'm pretty sure I've done something wrong here...but it sounds cool. So expect a 'pvoc2' at somepoint which may be a technically more correct version.</p>
