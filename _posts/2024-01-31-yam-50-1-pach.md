<h1>Recording of Pachelbel's Canon</h1>
<!--more-->

<p>Recently bought a new digital piano. A Yamaha CLP-775. With the purchase I also received the Yamaha piano book of '50 Classical Music Masterpieces'. I'm hoping to get through the whole book, so will start posting some recordings starting with this one: Pachelbel's Canon.</p>
