<p>The Spectral Suite is a collection of FFT plugins for manipulating spectral content. It consists of: </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Spectral gate</strong></li>
<p>Only allow frequencies above or below a particular cutoff. This is great for only allowing the strongest frequencies through.</p>
<li><strong>Frequency Shifter</strong></li>
<p>This will shift frequencies up or down a specified amount. Excellent for transforming human vocals into a metallic robotic sound.</p>
<li><strong>Bin Scrambler</strong></li>
<p>Randomly map the amplitudes of one frequency component to another. This is a great effect for completely transforming a sound.</p>
<li><strong>Frequency Magnet</strong></li>
<p>This will shift frequencies to gradually focus on a particular frequency.</p>
<li><strong>Sinusoidal Shaped Filter</strong></li>
<p>This applies a sinusoidal shape over the amplitudes of the frequency components.</p>
</ul>

<p>Version 2.0.0 has used the <a href="https://juce.com/">JUCE</a> framework to completely rewrite the UI of the plugins leading to a more consistent and simplified experience.</p>
