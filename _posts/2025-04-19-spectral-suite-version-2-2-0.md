<h1>Spectral Suite version 2.2.0 released</h1>
<p>Version 2.2.0 of the <a href="/spectralsuite">Spectral Suite</a> has now been released.</p>
<!--more-->

<p>This adds a 'Scale' paramter to frequency shift. Bit of a work in progress as it's not too effective outside of a small range of initial frequency shift.</p>
