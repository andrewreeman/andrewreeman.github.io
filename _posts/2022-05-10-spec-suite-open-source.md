<h1>Spectral Suite has now been open sourced!</h1>
<!--more-->
<p>It's been a goal for a while to open source the spectral suite. My hope is to evolve a useful toolkit or base projects for creating fft based plugins. I'm exited to see other creators use parts or all of this codebase in their own projects and perhaps improve the features of spectral suite too. These plugins will still be worked on and now in public! No hiding away anymore...</p>
