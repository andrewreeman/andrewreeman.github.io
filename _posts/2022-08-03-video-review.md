<h1>Video review</h1>

<p>Since we don't yet have much in the way of user guides or documentation this is a great resource to view. It's also useful as an overview of what FFT is and how it works. He also has a load of tutorials on dsp and features of Abelton. Worth checking out. Thanks so much to Naricol for taking the time to create this and it's great to hear that he enjoys using them. </p>
