<!--more-->
<p>In this release a new settings panel has been added to the Frequency Shifter and the Bin Scrambler.</p>
<p>In the Bin Scrambler settings panel you can now specify the random seed. This can help make the bin scrambler deterministic. To go back to being non-deterministic set this to 0.</p>
<p>The Frequency Shifter settings panel allows you to set the minimum and maximum frequency ranges on the slider.</p>
